# `UFFIZZI_URL` environment variable

Each Uffizzi environment is assigned a unique, public URL that exists for the lifetime of the environment. This URL is accessible to all containers of your deployment via the environment variable `UFFIZZI_URL`. 
## Uses

It is often the case that components of an application need to know the endpoint of their host environment. For example, you may want your API to provide its own documentation using a tool like Swagger. Since Uffizzi URLs are dynamically generated when your application is deployed, you cannot preconfigure Swagger with the host URL. However, you can use `UFFIZZI_URL` to dynamically set the value of your API endpoint when it is generated by Uffizzi.
